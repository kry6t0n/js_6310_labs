## 🔄 Workflow Example

1. **Login** with demo credentials
2. **Navigate to Editor** to create a new network topology
3. **Add Devices** by clicking "Add Node" and selecting device type
4. **Configure Devices** with IP addresses and subnet masks in the right sidebar
5. **Create Connections** by dragging from one device to another
6. **Adjust Connection Properties**:
   - Change connection type (Physical/Routing/Logical)
   - Set status (Active/Inactive/Error)
   - Add bandwidth information
   - Add custom description
7. **Validate and Save** - System checks compatibility and saves to localStorage
8. **Export Project** - Download as JSON for backup or sharing
9. **View Projects** - Go to Account page to manage all saved topologies

## 🧠 Connection Logic Details

### Device Compatibility

The system prevents invalid connections based on device types:
- **Physical connections** work between: Router↔Switch, Switch↔Server, Switch↔Workstation, Any↔Network
- **Routing connections** work between: Router↔Router, Router↔Network
- **Logical connections** work between any devices with IP addresses

### IP Subnet Validation

When connecting devices (excluding Router and Network):
- IP addresses must be in the same subnet
- Subnet masks must be compatible using CIDR notation
- Examples:
  - ✅ `192.168.1.5/24` connects to `192.168.1.10/24` (same subnet)
  - ❌ `192.168.1.5/24` does NOT connect to `192.168.2.5/24` (different subnets)
  - ✅ `10.0.0.5/16` connects to `10.0.5.10/16` (same /16 subnet)

### Automatic Type Suggestion

When you try to connect two devices, the system suggests the appropriate connection type:
- Same subnet → Physical
- Different subnets with Router → Routing
- Virtual connections → Logical

## 🔐 Security & Limitations

⚠️ **This is a demo/educational application**

### Security Notes
- User credentials are hardcoded for demonstration purposes
- No backend API or authentication server
- Data stored only in browser localStorage (not encrypted)
- Not suitable for production use without modifications
- No persistent database

### For Production Use:
- Implement proper backend authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
- Add database persistence (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Implement proper authorization checks on server
- Add comprehensive audit logging
- Use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Implement CORS properly

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- [ ] Backend API with database persistence
- [ ] Real-time collaboration (WebSocket support)
- [ ] Device grouping and virtual networks
- [ ] Network statistics and analytics dashboard
- [ ] Connection bandwidth visualization
- [ ] Network simulation and traffic modeling
- [ ] Export to diagram formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] Network device templates library
- [ ] Drag-to-select multiple nodes
- [ ] Undo/Redo functionality

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Can I save projects to a database?**
A: Currently, projects are saved to browser localStorage only. To use a database, implement a backend API with Express.js, Node.js, or similar.

**Q: Can multiple users collaborate in real-time?**
A: Not yet. This feature would require WebSocket support, real-time synchronization, and a backend server.

**Q: Is this suitable for managing production networks?**
A: No, this is an educational tool. For real network management, use enterprise solutions like Cisco Prime Infrastructure, Juniper Contrail, or open-source alternatives like GNS3.

**Q: How are device IPs validated?**
A: The system calculates network addresses using CIDR notation and checks subnet compatibility. Invalid IP formats or duplicate addresses are rejected.

**Q: Can I export the network diagram as an image?**
A: Currently, you can export as JSON. Image export would require additional libraries like html2canvas or similar.

**Q: What browsers are supported?**
A: All modern browsers: Chrome/Chromium 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
